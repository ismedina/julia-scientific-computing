    "\n",
    "One of the aspects of Julia that makes it specially suitable for scientific computing is that support for parallelism is integrated in the very core of the language. Besides, different approches to parallelism are possible: from very basic instructions such as which data send to which processor, to nonchalant macros that send everything to all the threads and let them work their way. In this notebook we will explore briefly the second scenario, which is specially useful in the case that we have a lot of (almost) independent processes that can run without conflicting each other.\n",
