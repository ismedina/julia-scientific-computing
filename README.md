# Julia for scientific computing

A quick introduction to Julia essentials by programming the gradient descent algorithm. Designed specially for those using Python/Matlab for scientific computing that want to learn the basics of Julia to start coding in this language as soon as possible, without having to go through a thorough course.

## Installation

The introduction is given in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. To set up Julia and/or Jupyter, visit https://datatofish.com/add-julia-to-jupyter/.

I will provide a link to a cloud-based version of the tutorial as soon as there is someone that supports Julia.
