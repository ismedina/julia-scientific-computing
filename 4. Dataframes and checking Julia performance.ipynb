    "# 4.1 Conway's *Game of Life*\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a taste about Julia's speed we are going to code Conway's *Game of Life*. But before explaining its basic rules, let's watch a cool gif of it:\n",
    "\n",
    "![game of life gif](figures/game_of_life.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's this \"Game of Life\"? Well, it is a *cellular automaton*: a 2D, infinite grid of cells ― each of which can be *alive* or *dead*―, together with rules for wether they stay in the same state or change it. In Life the next state of a cell only depends on the states of the 8 nearest neighbors, and according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) the rules for every iteration are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n",
    "* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n",
    "* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize this with the following protocol. Assuming that the state of the cell $(i,j)$ is stored in `A[i,j]` (as `1` if the cell is alive and `0` if it is dead), then in each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an array `B` with the same shape as `A` and all zeros.\n",
    "2. For each cell $(i,j)$, if either:\n",
    "    * the sum of live neighbors is 3 (regardless of the state of cell $(i,j)$), or \n",
    "    * the sum of live neighbors is 2 *and* cell $(i,j)$ is alive, \n",
    "    \n",
    "  then set `B[i,j] = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function `my_game_it(A)` that given the current state of the game `A` returns the status of the grid in the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** Since in the original game the grid is infinite, to fit it into an array we should define some *boundary conditions*, i.e., the value of the cells at the edge of our array. Two widely used possibilities (among which you can choose your favorite) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *zero boundary conditions*, i.e., setting all boundary values to zero. This is a bit easier to code but leads to spurious results when the living cells reach the boundary.\n",
    "* *periodic boundary conditions*: i.e., *gluing* the edges. In this case we must take care of how we define the nearest neighbors at the edges. There you may want to use some `if` statements of the kind:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "if j == 1 \n",
    "    j_left = N\n",
    "else\n",
    "    j_left = j-1\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or more concisely, using the so called *ternary operator*:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "j == 1 ? j_left = N : j_left = j-1\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is the Julia equivalent for the Python expression \n",
    "```python \n",
    "j = N if j==1 else j-1```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** Pay attention to the order of the loops! Since Julia is column-major, which loop should go inside to get the maximum speed?"

Now, I am pretty sure that your implementation is good, but it's never a bad idea to check Julia's [performance tips](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/). Some of the most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Avoid global variables**: so far so good (I hope).\n",
    "* **Measure performance with `@time` and pay attention to memory allocation**: good, let's do it. For the version in the solutions the first time I run it with a 1024x1024 input I obtained the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```0.054303 seconds (49.75 k allocations: 10.554 MiB, 11.94% gc time)```\n",

    "\n",

    "  * **`seconds`** of course is the total time elapsed.\n",
    "  * **`allocation`** is the act of reserving space in memmory, and **`gc`**, or *garbage collection*, is the freeing of this memory. Unexpectedly high allocations (and specially gc) are usually a sign of some problem in the code, often related to the creation of a high number of temporary arrays.\n",
    "  \n",
    "So why are the results so different? Well, the first time `my_game_it` and `@time` are run, they must be compiled, which will consume resources. That's why you shouldn't take the first result seriously. When run a second time, the compiler checks if there exists an already compiled `my_game_it` for the current type of inputs. In case there is, cheers! It only has to run it again, with a different input. The second run of `@time` yields a much better result, which make us confident that our code is probably working nicely.\n",

    "Other important performance tips are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Write type-stable code**. Julia performance comes from compiling the code, and the compiler won't have an easy time if the types of the variables are ambiguous or get changed all the time. Think about it this way:\n",
    "    * If the code for a function is type-stable, most of the decisions regarding types and memory are made at *compile time*, i.e., only the first time that you run it. \n",
    "    * However, if the code is not type-stable, decisions must be made at *run time*, happening every time and thus slowing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For this reason, though it is technically possible to change the type of variables, you shouldn't do it as long as you can avoid it. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Likewise, **Arrays should be initialized belonging to some specific type** (`Int64`, `Float64`,...) that its suited for the subsequent operations and not just `Any`, if this is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "An incredible macro for checking type-stability is `@code_warntype`. It runs the code and checks the variables for type ambiguities: if a type is completely determined, it prints it in blue; if it is `Any` (this is, it could be anything, slowing performance), it prints it red; and if it is not completely determined but it's not a big deal ---for example, if it must be one of two options--- it writes it yellow.
