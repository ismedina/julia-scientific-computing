    "# 4.1 Conway's *Game of Life*\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a taste about Julia's speed we are going to code Conway's *Game of Life*. But before explaining its basic rules, let's watch a cool gif of it:\n",
    "\n",
    "![game of life gif](figures/game_of_life.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "So what's this \"Game of Life\"? Well, it is a *cellular automaton*: a 2D, infinite grid of cells ― each of which can be *alive* or *dead*―, together with rules for wether they stay in the same state or change it. In Life the next state of a cell only depends on the states of the 8 nearest neighbors, and according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) the rules for every iteration are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n",
    "* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n",
    "* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize this with the following protocol. Assuming that the state of the cell $(i,j)$ is stored in `A[i,j]` (as `1` if the cell is alive and `0` if it is dead), then in each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an array `B` with the same shape as `A` and all zeros.\n",
    "2. For each cell $(i,j)$, if either:\n",
    "    * the sum of live neighbors is 3 (regardless of the state of cell $(i,j)$), or \n",
    "    * the sum of live neighbors is 2 *and* cell $(i,j)$ is alive, \n",
    "    \n",
    "  then set `B[i,j] = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function `my_game_it(A)` that given the current state of the game `A` returns the status of the grid in the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** Since in the original game the grid is infinite, to fit it into an array we should define some *boundary conditions*, i.e., the value of the cells at the edge of our array. Two widely used possibilities (among which you can choose your favorite) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *zero boundary conditions*, i.e., setting all boundary values to zero. This is a bit easier to code but leads to spurious results when the living cells reach the boundary.\n",
    "* *periodic boundary conditions*: i.e., *gluing* the edges. In this case we must take care of how we define the nearest neighbors at the edges. There you may want to use some `if` statements of the kind:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "if j == 1 \n",
    "    j_left = N\n",
    "else\n",
    "    j_left = j-1\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or more concisely, using the so called *ternary operator*:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "j == 1 ? j_left = N : j_left = j-1\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is the Julia equivalent for the Python expression \n",
    "```python \n",
    "j = N if j==1 else j-1```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** Pay attention to the order of the loops! Since Julia is column-major, which loop should go inside to get the maximum speed?"

    "    * If the code for a function is type-stable, most of the decisions regarding types and memory are made at *compile time*, i.e., only the first time that you run it. \n",
    "    * However, if the code is not type-stable, decisions must be made at *run time*, happening every time and thus slowing performance.\n",
